This project is a beginning project for working as
a student worker for Bethel Web Development. It
incorporates the basics of what they do and touches
on various parts of what I will be working with in
the future. These parts include HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
Python, Flask, Jinja, AJAX, and JQuery.

Files for this project are index.html, board.html,
buttons.js, buttonStyle.css, __init__.py in the views
folder and __init__.py in the app folder, as well as
a requirements.txt text file and run.py.
